        <para>David J. Birnbaum is Professor and Chair of the Department of Slavic Languages and
          Literatures at the University of Pittsburgh. He has been involved in the study of
          electronic text technology since the mid-1980s, has delivered presentations at a variety
          of electronic text technology conferences, and has served on the board of the Association
          for Computers and the Humanities, the editorial board of <emphasis role="ital">Markup
            languages: Theory and practice</emphasis>, and the Text Encoding Initiative Council.
          Much of his electronic text work intersects with his research in medieval Slavic
          manuscript studies, but he also often writes about issues in the philosophy of
          markup.</para>

    <title>Rationale for moving beyond XML</title>
    <para>Textual data is unstructured. Markups needs to be added to extract information from it.
      The most popular markup format to store textual data and markup is XML. XML follows a
      hierarchial model that allows one to add structure to a file. This works well for dividing
      text into chapters and paragraphs. However there are limitations.</para>
    <para>Adding a second hierarcy is difficult, since XML markup syntax requires that the last
      opened tag is closed first. Adding the structure of the pages for example overlaps with the
      stucture of the chapters and paragraphs. This can be worked around by adding a second
      hierarchy as milestones instead of start and end elements.</para>
    <para>The problem here is that one hierarchiy is handled differently from the second hierarchy.
      The leading hierarchy is modeled using full start and elements.</para>
    <para>Modeling multiple hierarchies is possible in XML, but difficult because the second or
      third etc hierarchy needs to be modelled differently from the first hierarchy. This also leads
      to challenges when querying or transforming the data contained in the file.</para>
    <para>There are many real use cases where there are multiple hierarchies present in the data:
      poetry, stage plays.</para>

    <title>LMNL markup file format</title>
    <para>The LMNL markup file format removes the constraint that the last opened has to be closed
      first. That means that it is possible to model overlapping hierarchies in LMNL. To be more
      precise, it is possible to model annotations with one hierarchy, multiple hierarchies or no
      hierarchy at all. This allows for a great freedom to model all kinds of information on textual
      content. This is great from a content perspective. However LMNL is more expensive from a
      computational perspective.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Conceptual model</title>
    <para>The conceptual datamodel behind is XML is the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM
      represents a tree based data structure. The data model behind LMNL is different, in that it is
      based on ranges, based on offsets on textual content.</para>

    <title>Text as a graph</title>
    <para>This paper proposes to use a different data model than trees or ranges. It proposes to use
      a graph based model, we call text as graph (TAG). Graph models for text have been proposed
      before (GODDAG), but the model proposed in this paper differs in the fact that not just a
      directed graph is used, but a directed graph is used in combination with a hypergraph.</para>
