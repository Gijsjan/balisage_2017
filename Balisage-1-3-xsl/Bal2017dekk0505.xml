    rhd: There is one more thing that we might have to discuss: a lot of scholars when they 
    hear/read the word graph think of semantic networks. It is important to stress that a 
    text graph is not a semantic network. In the markup of an annotation layer it is of 
    course possible to link to persons, places, organisations, events etc in a semantic 
    network. The main point is that although a text graph and a semantic network are both 
    networks, and they can link to each other, there are not the same. I suspect the Balisage 
    crowd is more aware of this than the average  scholars but still. There are some Balisage 
    papers that advocate combining XML with semantic networks. A text graph approach is still 
    different from that approach. So maybe it would good to explicitly mention that to avoid 
    confusion.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>The XML tree paradigm has several well-known limitations for document modeling and
      processing, some of which have received a lot of attention (especially overlap; see the
      overviews in <xref linkend="sperberg-huitfeldt_2000"/> and <xref linkend="derose_2004"/>) and
      some of which have received less (e.g., discontinuity, simultaneity, transposition, white
      space as crypto-overlap). Many of these have work-arounds, also well known, that—as is
      implicit in the term <quote>work-around</quote>—have disadvantages, but because they get the
      job done and because XML has a large user community with diverse levels of technological
      competence, it is difficult to overcome inertia and move to a technology that might offer a
      more comprehensive fit with the full range of document structures with which researchers need
      to interact both intellectually and programmatically. Proceeding from a high-level view of why
      XML has the limitations it has, this presentation explores how an alternative model of Text as
      Graph (TAG) might address these types of structures and tasks in a more natural and idiomatic
      way than is available within an XML paradigm.</para>
    <para>From an informatic perspective all documents are structured, including those are
      traditionally identified as plain text. Some of the structural properties of plain-text
      documents are expressed through formatting conventions, such as the use of blank lines to
      separate paragraphs, or of indentation to mark the beginning of a paragraph, or of centering
      to mark a header. The sequence of words in a text, delimited in a complex way that involves
      white space, punctuation, and other symbols, constitutes, on a certain level, an
      organizational tier above the sequence of characters.<footnote>
        <para>Others properties, often more lexical than structural, may depend on contextual
          information that is not always expressed explicitly. For example, a capitalized reference
          to <quote>London</quote> is formally marked as a proper noun by capitalization, but
          whether it is a placename in England (or Ohio or Ontario or elsewhere) or the personal
          name of a US writer may not be represented formally.</para>
      </footnote> The conventions at work in plain text do not formally, completely, unambiguously,
      or in a wholly standardized way differentiate the content of a document from the coded
      representation of its structure (or, perhaps more accurately, structures), which complicates
      document processing (whether for data mining, publication, or other purposes). The challenge
      this poses has come to be addressed by representing the structural properties of a document
      not with plain-text characters (which might be considered pseudo-markup), but through
      standardized, formal markup, such as XML.</para>
    <para>The XML data model is a tree, or, more precisely, a rooted and ordered directed acyclic
      graph that prohibits multiple parentage, which in the document-processing community has come
      to be understood as representing an Ordered Hierarchy of Content Objects (OHCO). The OHCO
      model works well for describing structures that consist of single ordered hierarchies, such as
      the exhaustive tesselated division of a novel into chapters and the chapters into paragraphs.
      It is not well suited to structures that cannot be modeled fully as a single tree.<footnote>
        <para>The OHCO literature is already well known to the Balisage audience, and it is not our
          goal to provide an exhaustive bibliography. The seminal papers that advocated for OHCO as
          a document model are <xref linkend="coombs_1987"/> and <xref linkend="derose_1990"/>; the
          seminal examination of the limitations of OHCO, by some of the same authors, is <xref
            linkend="renear_1996"/> (first introduced as a conference presentation in 1992). Wendell
          Piez discusses issues pertaining to overlap and OHCO, and the alternative range model
          implemented in LMNL, in <xref linkend="piez_2014"/>.</para>
      </footnote> The markup community has focused intensively on overlapping hierarchies as a
      challenge to the OHCO model,<footnote>
        <para>Within the Balisage community, at present
            <link>http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/topics/Concurrent_Markup~Overlap.html</link>
          lists twenty-five presentations from 2008 through 2016</para>
      </footnote> and with good reason, but we argue below that overlap is only one manifestation of
      a higher-level problem, and this perspective has implications for deciding how best to
      overcome it. If overlap were <emphasis role="ital">the</emphasis> problem, projecting multiple
      trees over the content might solve it (e.g., through the SGML <emphasis role="bold"
        >CONCUR</emphasis> feature<footnote>
        <para>See, e.g., <xref linkend="hilbert_2005"/>.</para>
      </footnote>), as might the adoption of a model that permits but does not require hierarchy,
      including multiple hierarchies, such as the range model exemplified by LMNL.<footnote>
        <para>See especially <xref linkend="piez_2014"/>.</para>
      </footnote> But if the problem is that a tree is inadequate for higher-level reasons that are
      only partially exemplified by overlap, we might have more success if we address the issue at
      that higher level.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Desiderata for an improved text model</title>
    <!-- Michael and Claus 2008 emphasize that TEI markup requires semantics, while ours is in the model
      TexMECS has a strategy for this, while LMNL doesn't; do we need a TexMECS parser -->
    <!-- TexMECS requires quotations to be divided in the model, while we don't -->
    <para>The principal challenge to XML as a model of text is generally regarded as overlap, that
      is, that text has structural properties that humans care about that cannot be modeled directly
      as a tree, or, at least, as a rooted and ordered directed acyclic graph that does not permit
      multiple parentage and that is constructed from the seven types of nodes that constitute the
      XQuery and XPath data model.[<xref linkend="xdm6"/>] Although overlap has received most of the
      attention, overlap is only one challenge to XML modeling, and regarding overlap as <emphasis
        role="ital">the problem</emphasis>, instead of as <emphasis role="ital">a symptom of the
        problem</emphasis>, has led us to think more narrowly than we should about alternatives to
      OHCO. If what text <quote>really is</quote> is not an ordered hierarchy of content objects,
      what is it instead? The issues are well known to the XML community, so why have they come
      largely (although not entirely) to be eclipsed by overlap in discussions of what’s difficult
      about modeling documents in XML? These challenges, which have been negotiated in XML modeling
      and processing through workarounds, find a natural solution in the TAG model described here,
      as well as, at least in some respects, in LMNL and GODDAG/TexMECS.</para>
    <para>A second challenge of using XML as a model of text involves not the <emphasis role="ital"
        >limitations</emphasis> of OHCO, but its <emphasis role="ital">tyranny</emphasis>. If text
      is understood as an ordered hierarchy of content objects, are there aspects of text that are
      not ordered, are there aspects that are not hierarchical (by which we mean not just that they
      are not mono-hierarchical, but that they are not hierarchical at all), and does the model
      create content objects artifactually, that is, where they are not perceived as inherent
      properties of the text being modeled? XML requires us to model all content as both ordered and
      hierarchical, and it represents content objects as elements (at least as content objects are
      described in <xref linkend="derose_1990"/>). The GODDAG and LMNL alternatives to XML, which
      are discussed below, both grew out of a recognition that not all properties of text can be
      modeled effectively as a single hierarchy, and their focus is not limited to that issue, but
      they differ in the extent to which they interrogate aspects of text that may not be
      hierarchical, that may not be ordered, and that may not involve what a human would consider a
      content object.</para>
    <para>A third challenge of discussing XML as a model of text is distinguishing XML as a data
      model from XML as a syntax, and the same applies to the LMNL data model vs the LMNL sawtooth
      syntax and the GODDAG data structure vs TexMECS syntax. Perhaps a bit surprisingly in the
      context of Balisage, which describes itself as <quote>the <emphasis role="ital"
          >markup</emphasis> conference</quote>, our focus here is not on markup (that is, on syntax
      and serialization), but on the data models that may be expressed through markup. Our somewhat
      simplified <xref linkend="XML_specs"/> illustration, below, regards the marked-up XML document
      as related to the XML InfoSet by the operations of serialization in one direction and parsing
      in the other. This matters because the serialization is, as is clear from the etymology of the
      term, committed to an ordered expression in ways that other representations of XML may not be,
      and the same is true of other data models and their associated syntactic expressions through
      markup. If, for example, a paragraph is exactly coextensive with a quotation, in XML syntax,
      LMNL sawtooth syntax, and TexMECS syntax, the start tag of either the paragraph or the
      quotation must come first in linear order. But in LMNL that order is not an obligatory part of
      the model, according to which the two ranges begin at the same location in the stream of atoms.<footnote>
        <para>LMNL is able to represent hierarchy, but it is not obligatory, and <quote>flat</quote>
          LMNL does not express hierarchy.</para>
      </footnote> In XML, though, one element must contain the other, and the order of the start
      tags reflects the hierarchy. TexMECS is capable of distinguishing when the order of the start
      tags is informational and when it is not.<footnote>
        <para>STAGO vs STAGSO and ETAGO vs ETAGSO [<xref linkend="huitfeldt_2003"/>, §2.3.]</para>
      </footnote></para>

      </caption>
    </figure>
    <para>A fourth issue, which intersects with the three above, involves distinguishing properties
      that inhere in the text being modeled from those that depend on semantics that must be
      interpreted at a higher (application) level. A failure to make this distinction may have two
      types of consequences: either the application must know that some properties of the model are
      not informational or the application must know that there is information that is not
      represented entirely by the model. If, however, the model explicitly represents the properties
      of the text and nothing else, the application level is freed from having to supplement the
      model, and can concentrate on features that are truly application-specific. Here are two
      illustrations of this issue:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The pairing of start and end tags in XML (or LMNL sawtooth or TexMECS) markup is
            inherent in the markup itself. In contrast, the pairing of XML milestones that are used
            to simulate container tags as a work-around for overlap (see the discussion of Trojan
            markup in <xref linkend="derose_2004"/>) relies on semantics. This means that
            applications do not have to know that regular start and end tags delimit an element, but
            they do have to know when empty tags are being used to simulate the beginning and end of
            a content object. Insofar as whether something is a content object is a property of the
            text being modeled, a robust and efficient strategy would represent it as part of the
            model itself, instead of requiring that it be handled through semantic information that
            is available only at the application level.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Because XML models an ordered hierarchy, elements always have order, which requires
            the application layer to distinguish situations where order is semantically meaningful
            from situations where it isn’t. For example, the TEI <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code>
            elements has the semantics of associating content objects that do not have a natural
            order with respect to one another, such as an abbreviation and its expansion or an error
            and its correction. How those should be handled is the business of the application
            layer, but the model requires that one option proceed or follow the other even when the
            order does not represent an inherent property of the text being modeled. A more robust
            and efficient strategy would not impose order when it must then be ignored, so that an
            application will be able to regard the presence or absence of order in the model as
            informational without recourse to semantics.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>An improved text model should have the following properties. In all instances where we
      write that <quote>the model should be able to X</quote>, we mean that it should be able to X
      without requiring access to semantic information at the application level. In other words, the
      components of the model should fully represent the properties of the text being modeled, with
      no extraneous artifactual properties that an application must then know to ignore. The
      following are characteristics we might ask of an improved text model:<itemizedlist>
        <!-- Add one-sentence examples of each of these -->
        <!-- Do we need to explain more clearly what we mean by "annotation" here? -->
        <listitem>
          <para>It should support both textual (character data) content and annotations (of the sort
            expressed in XML through element and attribute markup).</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>It should support but not require the representation of hierarchy, including
            multiple, partial, or overlapping hierarchies or annotations.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>With respect to reading, it should support queries for text, annotations, or a

          <para>With respect to workflow, it should be possible to defer decisions about relations
            among layers. For example, it should be possible to create annotations without hierarchy
            and apply a hierarchy only later. This deferral might be compared to the way XML
            documents may be validated against schemas that may be created and associated only after
            a fully functional well-formed document has been created.</para>

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>With respect to I/O, a system that implements the model should support serialization
            as plain text on export and the parsing of such serializations on import. TAG does not
            currently have its own syntax; it can read and write LMNL syntax (although not all TAG
            properties currently have a defined representation in LMNL syntax), and it is intended
            to be able to read and write TexMECS.<footnote>
              <para>Neither LMNL sawtooth syntax nor TexMECS can represent all features of TAG. For
                example, LMNL supports annotations on annotations, while TexMECS doesn’t. TexMECS
                supports hierarchy, while LMNL sawtooth syntax does not. LMNL can represent
                hierarchy through the <emphasis role="ital">limen</emphasis>, but the limen
                currently has no defined representation in the syntax. [<xref linkend="piez_2008"/>]
                We leave unresolved for now the question of how to serialize fully all information
                in a TAG document.</para>

                except to say that it might not require a specialized, TAG-aware editor. One
                approach might involve the selective export of TAG information for manipulation in a
                third-party editor, followed by its reimport and reintegration into the TAG

        model and its implementation in Alexandria is that it can be used to read as well as write
        textual data and annotations. This opens up a lot of new possibilities and makes it a

        text, markup (roughly comparable to XML elements), and annotations (roughly comparable to
        what XML attributes would be like if they could contain markup). A hypergraph consists of a
        set of nodes and a set of hyperedges. Nodes and edges have types, and may also have other
        properties.</para>
      <para>Graph models for text and markup have been proposed before (GODDAG [see, e.g., <xref
          linkend="sperberg-huitfeldt_2000"/>], GrAF [see, e.g., <xref linkend="ide_2007"/>]), but
        the model advanced in this paper differs from those because it incorporates a <emphasis
          role="bold">hypergraph</emphasis>. Hypergraphs differ from traditional graphs, the edges
        of which can connect only two nodes with each other, because the edges in a hypergraph can
        connect more than two nodes with one another, and for that reason they are called <emphasis
          role="bold">hyperedges</emphasis>. Hypergraphs can have directed and undirected
        hyperedges. Undirected hyperedges contain a set of nodes, and in this paper we refer to them
        as <quote>sets</quote>. Directed hyperedges contain two sets of nodes, one for the source
        (called the <emphasis role="bold">head</emphasis>) and one for the target (called the
          <emphasis role="bold">tail</emphasis>). The direction of a (hyper)edge may be used to
        model an order or a hierarchy of the nodes, but directionality does not obligatorily imply
        either order or hierarchy. Hypergraphs are especially valuable for text modeling because
        they can be implemented using sets, and methods for reasoning over and operating on sets are
        proven and well known.</para>

      <title>How TAG represents structural properties of text</title>
      <section>
        <title>Order</title>
        <para>A distinctive feature of the TAG model is that textual content is an ordered set of
          Text nodes, but Markup nodes are not ordered. Because markup all points directly or
          through intermediaries to Text nodes, the order of Markup nodes becomes a derived property
          of the order of the Text nodes to which the markup applies. This bottom-up perspective on
          order within a document distinguishes TAG from the top-down, ordered-tree perspective of
          XML and GODDAG, where, contrary to TAG, the order of nodes (including <code>text()</code>
          nodes) is at least partially derived from the order of their parent nodes. In this respect
          TAG is closer to LMNL, where order in the document also inheres at the lowest level, which
          in LMNL is the atoms that make up the content.</para>
        <para>Some subsets of Text nodes in TAG are not mutually ordered. For example, the TEI XML
            <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code> element wraps child elements that do not have a logical
          mutual order, such as an abbreviation and its expansion or an error and its correction. In
          XML, artifactual order of this sort cannot be excluded from the model, and must therefore
          be ignored at the application level. Order in TAG is not artifactual, and sets of Text
          nodes that are not mutually ordered logically do not have order in the model.</para>
        <para>Some subsets of Text nodes in TAG may have contradictory order. A traditional
          challenge for markup languages involves transpositions, of the sort that occur when
          creating critical editions in which the textual witnesses may contain some of the same
          words, but with reordering. Drawing on the <emphasis role="bold">variant graph</emphasis>
          structure used to model textual variation in the open-source CollateX collation tool
            [<xref linkend="collatex"/>], TAG models transposition through labeled normal edges
          between Text nodes. The order of the text in any witness can thus be identified by
          following the labeled edges.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Textual content</title>
        <para>Textual content in TAG is represented by nodes of the type Text, each of which
          represents a segment of textual content (there are also empty Text nodes). The order of
          the text is stored as directed edges between pairs of Text nodes; this chain begins at the
          document node, which points to the first Text node. Except in situations involving text
          that is locally unordered and variant text with differing order (see above), a single,
          unbroken chain connects all Text nodes in the document except those in annotations.
          Annotations (see below), which typically encode metadata, can be understood as ancillary
          documents, and their textual content is modeled in separate chains that begin at the
          Annotation node.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Markup</title>
        <para>Markup in XML performs four functions simultaneously: <emphasis role="bold"
            >containment</emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold">dominance</emphasis> (<emphasis
            role="bold">hierarchy</emphasis>), <emphasis role="bold">datatyping</emphasis>, and
            <emphasis role="bold">order</emphasis>. In XML, an ancestor element both <emphasis
            role="bold">contains</emphasis> (starts before and ends after) its descendants and
            <emphasis role="bold">dominates</emphasis> them (is connected to them by a path that
          travels only downward in the tree). An XML element specifies a <emphasis role="bold"
            >type</emphasis> (through the generic identifier), and it instantiates <emphasis
            role="bold">order</emphasis> because XML is defined as an ordered tree of nodes,
          including element nodes.</para>
        <para>TAG separates these four functions. As described above, <emphasis role="bold"
            >order</emphasis> in TAG is a property only of Text nodes (and Annotation nodes, about
          which see below). <emphasis role="bold">Containment</emphasis> is modeled by subset
          relations that are independent of any hierarchy; it is axiomatic that a superset (of Text
          nodes) <emphasis role="ital">contains</emphasis> all of its subsets. <emphasis role="bold"
            >Datatyping</emphasis> is implemented through Markup-to-Text hyperedges that point from
          a Markup node to a set of Text nodes, where the hyperedge has a Name property, the value
          of which is comparable to the generic identifier (name) of an XML element. Unlike in XML,
          however, Markup-to-Text hyperedges do not model hierarchy; their only function is
          datatyping. Because Text nodes can have multiple incoming hyperedges on them, textual
          content can have multiple markup on it, and because Markup-to-Text hyperedges do not
          represent hierarchy, they do not engender overlap concerns. Annotations on Markup nodes
          provide supplementary information (metadata) about the node, similarly to attributes in
          XML, except that in TAG, as in LMNL, annotations are ordered and they can have rich
          content, and are not limited to just a name and an atomic value.</para>
        <para>Where dominance relations must be modeled, TAG uses Markup-to-Markup hyperedges to
          implement a hierarchy. The fact that hierarchy is optional is an important distinction
          from XML (single hierarchy) and GODDAG (one or more hierarchies).</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Overlap and self-overlap</title>
        <para>Overlap between the Text-node tails of two or more Markup nodes does not require a
          special construction in TAG. Each Markup-to-Text node points to a set of Text nodes, and
          those Text-node tails may or may not overlap with one another. In the set-based
          terminology of TAG, overlap describes a relationship between sets where there is a
          non-empty intersection and neither set is a subset of the other. In this respect, overlap
          of sets of Text nodes in TAG is similar to the LMNL overlap of ranges of atoms (but see
          immediately below about discontinuity). Self-overlap (in XML terms, overlap that would
          involve two elements with the same generic identifier) is not a special case in TAG
          because two Markup nodes with the same Name (datatype) each have their own hyperedge.
          Overlap in TAG, as in LMNL, is a matter of containment, rather than of dominance, while
          the tree-based foundation of XML and GODDAG require additional modeling to separate the
          two.</para>
        <para/>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Discontinuity</title>
        <para>In XML, GODDAG, and LMNL, discontinuity is expressed with more than one element
          (XML/GODDAG) or range (LMNL), and the fact that the discontinuous parts (with respect to
          hierarchical or linear structure) form a whole must be encoded separately. In TAG,
          discontinuity does does require a special construction because the set of Text nodes that
          constitute the tail of a Markup-to-Text hyperedge are not required to be continuous. This
          means there is only one Markup node for all the Text nodes in an instance of discontinuous
          markup, and no obligatory partitioning into segments that would then require subsequent
          reunification (higher in the hierarchy in GODDAG, in the limen in LMNL) is needed.</para>

              <quote>line</quote>). Text nodes in this case are entire lines of text, but they could
            also be smaller units; see the discussion of Overlap, below.</para>
        </caption>
      </figure>
      <para>The illustration of a TAG hypergraph of William Shakespearea’s Sonnet 71 (<xref
          linkend="sonnet-71_text"/>), above, includes a Document node, fourteen Text nodes, and
        eighteen Markup nodes (fourteen with their Name property value equal to <quote>line</quote>,
        three to <quote>quatrain</quote>, and one to <quote>couplet</quote>). Regular (one-to-one)
        edges start at the Document node and chain all Text nodes in textual order (see below about
        simultaneity and transposition). Hyperedges point from the Markup nodes into sets of Text
        nodes. In this case, hyperedges that start in Markup nodes with the Name property of
          <quote>line</quote> happen to point to a set that consists of a single Text node, and
        those with Name property values of <quote>quatrain</quote> and <quote>couplet</quote> happen
        to point to sets of four and two Text nodes, respectively. Note that in TAG, in contrast to
        an XML representation, a Markup node corresponding to the XML root element, although
        permitted, is not required, and we’ve omitted it here. Also in contrast to XML, the
          <quote>quatrain</quote> and <quote>couplet</quote> Markup nodes point directly to the Text
        nodes, and not to <quote>line</quote> Markup nodes (although that, too, is possible; see
        below about hierarchy).</para>
      <para>As was mentioned earlier, the XML data model does not distinguish containment from
        dominance, which Tennison explains as follows: <blockquote>
          <para>Containment is a happenstance relationship between ranges while dominance is one
            that has a meaningful semantic. A page may happen to <emphasis role="ital"
              >contain</emphasis> a stanza, but a poem <emphasis role="ital">domainates</emphasis>
            the stanzas that it contains.[<xref linkend="tennison_2008"/>]</para>
        </blockquote>In TAG, a Markup-to-Text hyperedge defines the tail as a set of Text nodes and
        and labels (datatypes) it. Containment is modeled by subset relations among the tails of
        Markup nodes. In this example, all quatrain and line Markup-to-Text edges point to sets of
        Text nodes. Where the Text nodes that constitute the tail of a line Markup-to-Text edge form
        a subset of the nodes that constitute the tail of a quatrain Markup-to-Text edge, the
        quatrain contains the line. In this emphasis on containment, rather than dominance, TAG is
        similar to flat LMNL, except that LMNL ranges must be continuous (LMNL handles discontinuity
        separately), while contiguity is not relevant in defining the set of Text nodes that may
        serve as the tail of a hyperedge in TAG (see the discussion of Discontinuity, below). In the
        example above, we have chosen not to encode dominance, but should we wish to do that, we can
        use Markup-to-Markup hyperedges, about which see below. Similarly, we have chosen not to
        make the three quatrains and the couplet children of what in XML terms would be a root
          <code>&lt;poem&gt;</code> element, but, should we wish, we could create a Markup-to-Text
        hyperedge with a Name property value of <quote>poem</quote> (which would point, through a
        hyperedge, to the set of all Text nodes in the poem), and add a one-to-many Markup-to-Markup
        hyperedge from it to the Markup nodes with <quote>quatrain</quote> and
          <quote>couplet</quote> Name property values . In other words, Markup-to-Text nodes model
        containment, rather than dominance, and where the developer needs to distinguish dominance
        from containment, the TAG model supports this through Markup-to-Markup hyperedges.</para>
      <para>As with any system for the representation of text, the choice of markup depends on a
        combination of properties inherent in the text and the features that are of interest to the
        person creating the markup. For example, we could also have created <quote>sentence</quote>
        markup nodes (and we do that in the discussion of Overlap, below), but for illustrative
        purposes the graph is easier to read without them.</para>
      <para>Here is the corresponding XML in markup and tree representations:</para>

              <para><emphasis role="bold">Text nodes.</emphasis> The textual content of a TAG
                document is stored in one or more text nodes, roughly comparable to XML
                  <code>text()</code> nodes. The order of the text nodes is represented by directed
                edges that connect them in textual order (see below about alternative order and
                unordered text nodes). The first text node can be recognized because there is a link
                to it from the document node. Text nodes may be empty; pointing from a markup node
                to an empty text node provides functionality comparable to that of empty elements in
                XML. Because TAG does not problematize overlap, it does not suffer from the XML use
                of empty elements to simulate the start and end tags of a subordinate

                comparable to the name of an XML attribute, and they point to would be an attribute
                value in XML (see the discussion of annotation to text nodes, below). The model also
                allows for annotation nodes on annotation nodes. There are no annotation nodes in

                example above, text node to text node directed edges point from the first text node

                Markup hyperedges connect a single markup node (head) to a homogeneous set of either
                text nodes or markup nodes (tail) as a way of tagging them with the markup in
                question. Note that the use of directed hyperedges allows us to connect <emphasis

                point to a set of one text node, the three <quote>quatrain</quote> markup nodes each
                point to a set of four text nodes, and the one <quote>couplet</quote> markup points
                to a set of two text nodes. Note that the <quote>quatrain</quote> and
                  <quote>couplet</quote> markup nodes point to text nodes, and not to the
                  <quote>line</quote> markup nodes (although a markup to markup hyperedge can be
                added if that is important). This is an important difference from the XML tree
                structure.</para>

              <para><emphasis role="bold">Annotation to text directed edges.</emphasis> These
                connect an annotation node to the first text node contained in that annotation,
                where the chain of text nodes is comparable to an XML attribute value. The chain of
                text nodes, then, contains the text of the annotation, not the original text.
                Separating the chain of text nodes in the document from those in the annotations is
                comparable to the fact that the values of attribute nodes in XML are not part of the
                string value of the document node. The nodes that constitute the textual value of an
                annotation may serve as the tail of markup nodes.</para>

    <title>How TAG addresses structures that are awkward for XML</title>
    <para>In this section we illustrate how several types of structures that are awkward for XML
      because they contradict or otherwise are not part of the OHCO tree model can be represented in
      a natural way in TAG. For each we provide an abstract description of the problem, of one or
      more XML workarounds, and of the TAG approach, illustrated with examples drawn from use cases
      in Digital Humanities research projects. The issues do not all pertain to the <quote>H</quote>
      (hierarchy) of OHCO; some involve <quote>O</quote> (order) or <quote>CO</quote> (content
      objects) components, and those that do pertain to hierarchy do not all involve overlap.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Overlap</title>
      <para>The challenge to modeling texts in XML that has attracted the most attention is overlap,
        but overlap is sometimes described as a property of XML serialization, rather than of the
        XML data model. Or, more precisely, overlap is one thing in the XML data model and a
        different, but related thing in an XML serialization. In the data model, overlap refers to
        multiple concurrent trees or partial trees, a situation that is not possible in XML because
        XML is defined as a single tree. Notice in the image below how the phrase <quote>Two vast
          and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desart</quote> begins in the middle of line 2 and
        ends in the middle of line 3, so that a tree of phrases overlaps a tree of lines:</para>

      <para>Piez’s illustration is actually of LMNL ranges (see below), rather than of XML element
        trees. The same structure might be visualized as overlapping trees as follows, where cyan
        represents the tree of metrical lines and green represents the tree of linguistic
        phrases:</para>

              <code>&lt;phrase&gt;</code> elements, and would instead be grouped inside
              <code>text()</code> node children of those elements.</para>
        </caption>
      </figure>
      <para>Because it is not possible to represent the preceding structure in XML markup, the
        following pseudo-XML is not well-formed:</para>
      <programlisting>&lt;line&gt;&lt;phrase&gt;Who said —&lt;/phrase&gt; &lt;phrase&gt;“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;line&gt;Stand in the desart….&lt;/phrase&gt; &lt;phrase&gt;Near them,&lt;/phrase&gt; &lt;phrase&gt;on the sand&lt;/phrase&gt;&lt;/line&gt;</programlisting>
      <para>New XML users often misunderstand the prohibition against overlap as a prohibition
        against overlapping <emphasis role="ital">tags</emphasis>, but if that were the issue, it
        could be remedied by simply removing the prohibition. The reality is that tags are a feature
        only of the <emphasis role="ital">serialization</emphasis> of XML, and XML as a <emphasis
          role="ital">data model</emphasis> has hierarchical elements, rather than tags. The reason
        overlap is prohibited, then, has nothing to do with a rule about tags; the rule about tags
        exists because tags must represent the data model, the hierarchy in the data model prohibits
        multiple parentage, and overlap would require that a <code>text()</code> node have more than
        one parent. Overlap is possible in GODDAG not because TexMECS permits overlapping tags, but
        because GODDAG permits <code>text()</code> nodes to have multiple parents and TexMECS
        serializes the GODDAG model. LMNL sawtooth syntax may look like XML syntax with the
        prohibition against overlapping tags removed, but the real difference is at the level of the
        data model: LMNL <emphasis role="ital">ranges</emphasis> may overlap, and the content
        between XML start and end tags is a sequence of descendant nodes in a tree, and not a range
        of atoms.</para>
      <para>TAG represents overlap naturally because the TAG counterpart to an XML element is a
        directed hyperedge that associates a head markup node with a set of tail nodes. To tag a
        line of poetry in the example above, TAG would create a hyperedge from a markup node with
        the name <quote>line</quote> (comparable to a <code>&lt;line&gt;</code> element in XML) to a
        set of text nodes (comparable to <code>text()</code> nodes in XML). Sets are unordered, but
        because the TAG automatically creates <quote>sequence</quote> edges between text nodes,
        which record the continuous order of the text stream (comparable to the sequence of atoms in
        the LMNL model), the textual content of the line is fully specified by (= can be retrieved
        by examining) the membership of the set of tail nodes and the sequence edges between them.
        In the illustration below, the black arrows represent regular edges that connect text nodes
        in order, the irregular colored bounding lines demarcate the sets of tail nodes, and a
        similarly colored arrow points into them from their markup node heads:</para>

        </footnote> Additional use cases involving overlap challenges in XML include pages vs
        paragraphs in publications of novels, folios vs texts in medieval manuscripts, and speeches
        vs metrical lines in drama. Overlap in poetic structures has been explored in detail in

      <title>Discontinuity</title>
      <para><xref linkend="sperberg-huitfeldt_2008"/> discusses the following paragraph from Lewis
        Carroll’s <emphasis role="ital">Alice in Wonderland</emphasis> as an example of
        discontinuity:</para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of
          having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading,
          but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <quote>and what is the use of a
            book,</quote> thought Alice <quote>without pictures or conversation?</quote></para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>There is no way to mark up this passage in XML without fragmenting the quotation into
        two elements (and relying on semantics to stitch together the pieces in the application
        layer), yet our human intuition is that there is a single quotation, and that the model,
        therefore, should represent it as a single object.<footnote>
          <para>It is possible to interpret the entire quotation as an element with three child
            nodes: a <code>text()</code> node, an intervening element that holds the narrative
            interjection, and then another <code>text()</code>, and in that sense the quotation is
            one object, although that object incorporates something that is not part of what a human
            understands as the quotation. <xref linkend="sperberg-huitfeldt_2008"/> explains why
            this is unsatisfactory (see especially their footnote 2).</para>
        </footnote> As <xref linkend="sperberg-huitfeldt_2008"/> also observe, there is a sense in
        which <quote>book</quote> and <quote>without</quote> are adjacent and a different sense in
        which <quote>book</quote> and <quote>thought</quote> are adjacent. The XML data model cannot
        represent both of these realities simultaneously, which means that at least one of them must
        be handed off to the application layer.</para>
      <para>
        <xref linkend="sperberg-huitfeldt_2008"/> situate this type of structure in a GODDAG
        context, where it intersects with the distinction between <emphasis role="ital"
          >containment</emphasis> and <emphasis role="ital">dominance</emphasis>. Concerning LMNL,
        they write that </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>[with respect to] the unity of discontinuous elements: such a unity may be asserted by
          the application layer (that is, by the definition of a LMNL vocabulary), but it is not
          visible on the LMNL level, and thus need not be accounted for at the level of LMNL
          itself.</para>
        <para>The design of LMNL thus seems to require that any account of dominance (as distinct
          from containment), and any account of discontinuous elements, be handled in the
          application layer. LMNL itself achieves a degree of simplicity and regularity as a result,
          at the expense of complexity in the application.</para>
      </blockquote>
      <para><xref linkend="piez_2008"/> describes discontinuity as modeled by the <emphasis
          role="ital">limen</emphasis>, where the example provided
          (<link>http://piez.org/wendell/LMNL/Amsterdam2008/presentation-slides.html#page23</link>)
        records it through coindexed annotations. That dependency seems to locate discontinuity in
        an application layer, since whether coindexed annotations represent discontinuity is not an
        inherent property of the coindexing.</para>
      <para>TAG prioritizes the representation of text structures, including discontinuity, in the
        model, without dependency on application-layer semantics. The example from Alice in

      <title>Artifactual hierarchy and datatyping</title>
      <para>In XML, markup is (among other things) a form of datatyping, and the XML spec uses the
        word <quote>type</quote> to say this:<blockquote>
          <para>Each element has a type, identified by name, sometimes called its <quote>generic
              identifier</quote> (GI) [<xref linkend="xml"/> §3]</para>
        </blockquote>This means that XML cannot assign a type to part of a document (other than an
        attribute, and there only through a schema specification) except by making it an element,
        and therefore a node in the document hierarchy. Consider the following XML structure,
        represented here in markup and as hierarchy:</para>
      <programlisting>&lt;title&gt;&lt;name&gt;Romeo&lt;/name&gt; and &lt;name&gt;Juliet&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</programlisting>

      </figure>
      <para>If we wish to specify in XML that the first and third words of the title are of type
          <quote>name</quote>, we can tag them as elements of that type, with the result that the
          <code>text()</code> nodes they contain wind up on a different level of the hierarchy than
        the conjunction between them.<footnote>
          <para>It is possible to tag the conjunction, as well, so as to push the word
              <quote>and</quote> down to the same hierarchical level as the names, but we have not
            observed that in practice. If the markup process involves tagging what the user
            considers informational, it should be possible to say that some text in this title is of
            a particular type <emphasis role="ital">that we care about sufficiently to specify the
              type in our markup</emphasis>, and other text is not, and to tag the former, but not
            the latter.</para>
        </footnote> This contradicts our intuition that the title contains three words, two of which
        have the type <quote>name</quote>, replacing it with a model in which the title contains two
        objects of type <quote>name</quote> with a word between them, and it is the
          <quote>name</quote> objects that contain the first and third words.</para>
      <para>TAG separates the use of markup in hierarchy and its use for datatyping, so that it is
        possible to assign a type to text without distorting the hierarhcy. Here is the TAG
        representation of the same content:</para>

          <para>In this TAG example, the markup on names specifies their type without imposing a
            hierarchy. The title contains three text nodes, represented by pink ellipses. Markup

            beige.</para>

      </figure>
      <para>As illustrated in the example above, markup of text nodes in the TAG model, unlike in
        XML, does not create a hierarchical layer as a side effect of datatyping. As we have seen
        earlier, in TAG, it is possible to represent hierarchy by creating hyperedges that point
        from one markup node to a set of markup nodes, but hierarchy is not an inescapable
        consequence of all markup in TAG, as it is in XML.</para>

    <title>Comparison of TAG/hypergraph to other text models</title>
    <para>In this section we compare and contrast the TAG data model with previous models for text
      modelling and processing, such as Information Set as implemented in DOM (tree), GODDAG
      (forrest/graph), and the LMNL data model(range).</para>
    <!-- This is a very generic overview... maybe not here -->
    <para>The document is written in a text serialization format, like XML or LMNL. It is then
      processed by a processor into memory model, like DOM. TAG is a replacement of DOM, competes
      with DOM, or with the Datamodel behind LMNL, based on ranges. NOTE: maybe a picture showing
      the use of XML markup to DOM and LMNL to TAG should be made to make clear what it is we are
      actually presenting here. The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API for XML processing. The
      alternative is XML Event processing. The DOM can contain both HTML and XML markup. </para>
    <section>
      <title>TAG and DOM</title>
      <para>Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for XML
        processing that contains a data model based on the XML Information Set. </para>
      <para>Both the DOM and TAG data models are node based. In both models the nodes are typed. The
        DOM consists of the following nodes: Document, DocumentType, DocumentFragment, Element,
        Text, ProcessingInstruction and Comment. Here is how the types in DOM and in TAG map to one
        another: the TAG Document node maps to the DOM Document node. In the place of the Element
        nodes of the DOM comes the Markup node of the TAG model. Text nodes in the DOM model are
        part of the TAG model as well. XML Attribute nodes map to TAG annotations. NOTE:
        ProcessingInstruction and Comments have no equivalent in TAG at the moment and are skipped
        for now in Alexandria, but could be added later. That is just an implementation
        detail.</para>
      <para>The difference between DOM and TAG lays in the way the nodes are laid out. In DOM the
        nodes are ordered in a tree hierarchy, while in TAG nodes are placed in a graph. The DOM
        model uses a tree based model, where there is a root node, which can have children, which
        are ordered sets. Every node can only have one parent node, and can only be child of one
        parent node. Thus representing a 1 to n relation between the parent and the childnodes. The
        TAG model uses a hypergraph instead, where nodes are connected through the use of
        hyperedges. Markup nodes can contain multiple Text nodes, while Text nodes can be part of
        multiple Markup nodes, thus allowing for n to n relations between text segments and markup
        nodes.</para>
      <para>In contrast with the DOM model there does not need to be a root element in the TAG
        model. A root element in TAG would simply be a markup node that is connected through a
        hyperedge with all the text nodes of the document. In fact there is no requirement to have a
        hierarchy at all.</para>
      <para>Also relations between markup nodes and text nodes or other markup nodes do not strictly
        have to be hierarchical. There can be multiple types of relationships between markup nodes.
        In DOM the relationship between a parent and a child is always one of dominance. By default
        there is no relation between markup nodes. Dominance relations can be expressed but have to
        be explicitly indicated by adding a edge between the two markup nodes of type Dominance.
        Containment relations can be calculated from the intersection of the text nodes of two
        markup nodes and does not have to be explicitly modelled.</para>
      <para>In the TAG hypergraph model a hyperedge that connects the text nodes with the markup
        nodes can be discontinuous. This is a clear difference with the DOM model, where all the
        text nodes are leaf nodes of the subtree underneath the element node. Thus the nodes
        underneath an element are continuous.</para>
      <para>In both the DOM and the TAG model adding a new text element or a new markup is a local
        operation.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>TAG and GODDAG</title>
      <para>The GODDAG datastructure allows for the storage of multiple hierarchies. Markup written
        in the MECS format can be parsed and read into memory. Elements that fully overlap are
        presumed to be dominating. Hierarchical structures are implied. Discontinuity is not
        supported. The graph is directed from the root node. The order of the text nodes is derived
        from the traversal of the element nodes. TAG differs in the sense that the order of text
        nodes is derived from explicit directed edges between the text segments. TAG differs in
        another way in the sense that relations between elements do not have to be one of
        domination. Relations between elements can be expressed by adding extra edges that are
        typed. The kind of relations can be determined later through the use of a schema. GODDAG and
        TAG are similar in the sense that they both support a N to N relation between elements
        (called markup in TAG) and PC-DATA nodes (called text nodes in TAG).</para>

        <title>Hypergraph versus ranges</title>
        <para>With the range conceptual model it is inexpensive to add extra annotation layers,
          however modifying the textual content is very expensive, since all the ranges of
          annotations that come after the point of insertion have to be recalculated. Hypergraph
          versus GODDAG: With the directed acyclic graph model it is inexpensive to add or change
          textual content, however since all the annotation nodes have to be connected to all the
          textual nodes involves this model scales badly with the number of textual nodes and the
          number of annotations. Hypergraph versus DOM: In the traditional tree model it is cheap to
          add or modify textual content and to add annotations, however there is only a single
          hierarchy. On top of that having a hierarchy is required. Scalability of the hypergraph
          model versus all the other models: In the hypergraph approach it is inexpensive (we really
          should use O notations here) to add or modify textual content, adding annotations is not
          as cheap as it is with ranges, (a new set needs to be created and a bit needs to be set
          for every text node involved), but it cheaper than the DAG model, since hypergraphs can be
          stored as sets rather than having to model individual edges.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Comparison of the hypergraph model with the LMNL markup file format</title>
        <para>A text graph representing all the data contained in a LMNL document consists of both a
          directed acyclic graph (DAG) and a hypergraph (HG). The DAG contains the range nodes, the
          annotation nodes, the edges between them, and all the text nodes and the edges between
          them. The HG contains all the hyperedges between the text nodes and the range nodes
          representing the many-to-many relation between them. That is, a text node has zero or more
          ranges on it, while a range can have zero or more text nodes associated with it. A range
          can be annotated, and an annotation can itself be annotated.</para>
        <para>The LMNL markup file format removes the constraint that the last opened has to be
          closed first. That means that it is possible to model overlapping hierarchies in LMNL. To
          be more precise, it is possible to model annotations with one hierarchy, multiple
          hierarchies or no hierarchy at all. This allows for a great freedom to model all kinds of
          information on textual content. This is great from a content perspective. However LMNL is
          more expensive from a computational perspective.</para>
        <para>LMNL data model LMNL documents contain text. Text can have ranges on them. Ranges can
          overlap. Ranges can be annotated on either the start tag or the end tag. Annotations can
          contain text themselves, that can have ranges, that can have annotations etc. Annotations
          can be annotated. Annotations on a range are ordered.</para>

        implementation of the TAG model. It allows the user to import and store text files in either

      <title>Import and export</title>
      <para> The Alexandria Markup system contains a parser that can import LMNL files and convert
        into an implementation of the TAG model in memory. Given the following LMNL markup "Hello
        World". We save this plain text transcription in a LMNL file. When we import this file into
        Alexandria a graph is created. The graph is very simple: it only consists of 2 nodes and 1
        edge. One Document node is created. One Text node is created, containing all of the text. An
        edge is created from the Document node to the text node associating the text with the
        document. When we change the LMNL markup to "[doc}Hello World{doc]" How serialization works
        A serialization of the TAG data model into a LMNL file is an example of an traversal over an
        instance. Start with the Document node. A document node has an outgoing edge to the first
        text node. Now we follow the hyperedges that are connect to this text node. There can be
        zero or more hyperedges present on a text nodes. Each hyperedge connects to one markup node.
        We collect all the markup nodes that are connected to the text node. For each of them we
        write a start tag. Then we go the next text node by following the outgoing edge to the next
        text node. Like before we collect all the markup node connected to this text node. We
        calculate the differences between the sets. For the intersection we do nothing. For markup
        nodes that are only the set of the previous nodes we write close tags. For the set of markup
        nodes that is only in the current set of markup nodes we write open tags. <emphasis

    <title>Example use case: tokenization with markup</title>
    <para>In natural language processing tokenization is the process of breaking a string of
      characters up into individual words. Tokenization is done using regular expressions. Regular
      expressions however only work on textual data and not on markup. (See the famous stackoverflow
      post for reference). On top of that the tokens themselves add another layer of information to
      file/model/data/document (not sure what the right word to use is here), which can overlap with
      the already existing hierarchy in the document. A data model for text that can handle multiple
      overlapping hierarchies or layers of annotations and that allows read as well as write
      operations can help out here. During tokenization all of the markup can be put 'aside' if it
      were and the tokenizer only pays attention to the textual content. The individual token are
      markup in a separate annotation layer. The existing markup layer are only ignored during
      tokenization, and still exist in the data.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <para>Tree models are top down. TAG is bottom up. LMNL is flat. XML conflates not only
      containment and dominance (hierarchy), but it also mixes in datatyping. A model that contains
      artifactual structures that must then be ignored by the application has poor design, even if
      there are no consequences for the output of processing. Oh, and did we mention order? XML is
      an ordered tree (as is GODDAG, and LMNL is an ordered sequence of atoms); TAG establishes text
      order with normal edges and derives markup order from the order of the text nodes to which the
      markup points, so order is separate from markup.</para>
