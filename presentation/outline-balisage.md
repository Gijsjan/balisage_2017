### introduction 
Title of presentation is "what text really is" -- it is not just overlap. It is also not just:  

- (un)ordered
- (dis)continuous
- hierarchie(s)

I propose that text, in essence, could be seen as this [show 3D visualization] 

### 1. textual phenomena

1. ..
2. ...
3. ....
4. .....

Select 2 phenomena and discuss *briefly* how they are modelled in XML and the disadvantages/shortcomings and work-arounds. Segway to:

### 2. TAG model

- ..
- ...
- ....

### 3. processing the TAG model

Advantages of modelling text as layers for processing. [Refer back to 3D visulization of layers.]

- ..
- ...
- ....

Mention here Alexandria ingesting plain text files, LMNL files, and TexMECS. Present it as an advantage.

### conclusion
TAG does not impose a hierarchy, but it allows one or more. Same for order. It thus addresses several textual phenomena that cannot be represented in other models without resorting to workarounds. As such it allows us to map and process textual phenomena in a natural and idiomatic way.
